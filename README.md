# Discrete Optimization

This is a collection of my solutions for discrete optimization course at Coursera. There are still some issues with the TSP problem(i.e. Problem No.4).

## Knapsack

Dynamic Programming + Branch and Bound with BFS(60/60)

## Coloring

Iterated Greedy(42/60)

## TSP

Greedy + Simulated Annealing + 2-Opt

## Facility Location

Gurobi Solver(64/80) It can be improved if set a larger time limit.

## Vehicle Routing

Greedy + Local Search + Google OR tool(45/60)
